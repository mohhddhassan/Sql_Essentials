**DDL (Data Definition Language) - SQL Queries**
This folder contains SQL examples of Data Definition Language (DDL) commands, which are used to define and modify the structure of database objects like tables, indexes, and constraints. DDL is essential for setting up and managing the database schema.

**Overview of DDL Commands**
Data Definition Language (DDL) includes commands that define the structure of a database. Below are the key DDL commands included in this folder:

  CREATE TABLE: Used to create a new table in the database with specified columns, data types, and constraints.

  ALTER TABLE: Allows modification of an existing table's structure, such as adding or dropping columns, modifying data types, or renaming       
  tables or columns.

  DROP TABLE: Removes an existing table and its data from the database.

  CREATE INDEX: Creates an index on one or more columns of a table to optimize query performance.

  DROP INDEX: Deletes an existing index.

  CREATE CONSTRAINTS: Defines rules like primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints to maintain data integrity.

**Key Concepts Covered**
Table Creation: How to define tables with various data types (e.g., VARCHAR, INT, DATE) and constraints like PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, etc.

Table Modification: How to add, modify, rename, or remove columns and constraints in an existing table.

Indexing: How to create and drop indexes to optimize performance for frequently queried columns.

Data Integrity: How to enforce data integrity using PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and UNIQUE constraints.
